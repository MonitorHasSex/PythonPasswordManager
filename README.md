# PythonPasswordManager
A basic encryption password manager I made for fun.

## How do you run it?
Simple. In Windows, make sure you have Python installed. Then type in cmd:

``pip install cryptography``

Then after its done installing, cd into the folder that you have the install.py file in, then type this:

``install.py``

Then it should bring you to a setup screen. After the setup file is done, just run the PPm.exe file and you're good to go.

## Disclaimer 
Dont expect this to be good, I created this to learn about python a bit more.
## What you need in order to run this
Latest version of Python:https://www.python.org/downloads/ (make sure you select this option when installing)

# PythonPasswordManager
Just trying to figure out how to make a basic encryption password manager for fun.
## How does it work?
The (Basic) idea is to make a password manager that has you set a master password. Then once you type the master password in, it tells you to type 1, 2, or 3. 1 just brings you to a prompt to encrypt whatever you type, 2 brings you to a prompt to decrypt a specific encrypted message, and 3 just lists the encrypted version of the previous stuff you typed in.
## How do you run it?
Simple. In Windows, make sure you have Python installed. Then do:

``pip install cryptography``

Then cd into the folder that you have the script in, then type this:

``PPm.py``

Then it should work.

## Disclaimer 
If i ever make this public and you want to use it, this is just a command line password manager that im trying to make (might make a terminal gui for it idk). Dont expect it to be the best (mainly because im a bit new to Python lmao).

## What you need in order to run this (at the moment)
Latest version of Python:https://www.python.org/downloads/ (make sure you select this option when installing)

Look at "How do you run it?" for everything you need.
(Ill upload the .py soon i promise lol)
